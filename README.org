#+TITLE: ModsynthGui


* ModsynthGui

A simple display for [[https://github.com/bwanab/sc_em][Modsynth]] circuits. The intent is to build this out so that it is a full fledged modular synth editor, but for now, display only is helpful.

#+CAPTION: An example circuit.
#+NAME:   fig:example

The filename box allows one to put in a name. Currently, it only looks in the sc_em examples directory. It assumes the .json for the filename, so that isn't needed. It's dorky, but the way to launch the file is to end with a space. That tells it to load the file and draw it.
