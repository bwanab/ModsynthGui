#+TITLE: ModsynthGui


* ModsynthGui

A simple display for [[https://github.com/bwanab/sc_em][Modsynth]] circuits. The intent is to build this out so that it is a full fledged modular synth editor, but for now, display only is helpful.

#+CAPTION: An example circuit.
#+NAME:   fig:example

For the GUI, it is using the [[https://github.com/boydm/scenic][Scenic]] library.

* Installation

Clone the repository for now.

To use, it requires the  [[https://github.com/bwanab/sc_em][Modsynth]] project to be present.

* Usage

iex -S mix

The filename box allows one to put in a name. Currently, it only looks in the sc_em examples directory. It assumes the .json for the filename, so that isn't needed. Hit the GO button to draw the graph. Hit the clear button to clear the graph to draw another.
